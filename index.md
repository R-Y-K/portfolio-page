# Introduction

Hello everyone! I'm R-Y-K and I'm a Unity Programmer with focus on AI-driven gameplay systems and modular design.
I have no real work experience, but I have been part of the team that published a game on Steam called Valiant Attempt,
which was done through a course called Ticorporate Demo Lab, in Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences.

## About Portfolio

This portfolio showcases two main systems I developed during 5 months of the Ticorporate Demo Lab course,
which purpose was to develop a demo of a video game to be published in Steam for Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences.

## About Featured Work - AI

I tried to design modular gameplay AI that form the core of the
game’s NPC decision-making for the project.

The AI is designed around designer-friendly implementation through the editor, where designer decides 
which behaviours are needed, for the the required role/purpose of the NPC,
which are then added to the behaviour, which can then assigned to the NPC in question.

Right now the AI can:
- Idle (Wait for Action/Condition to be triggered)
- Follow Player (Same as Idle, except NPC is Companion/Ally to the Player)
- Use Offensive Skills on Enemies, based on priority of the skill and use condition.
- Use Supporting Skills on Allies, based on priority of the skill and use condition.

If you want more in-depth explanation of how the AI works and to check out the scripts themselves

## About Featured Work - Skill System

Early during AI development, I quickly realized that I needed another modular system dedicated for the actions
that the AI behaviours could take, which would satisfy the requirements for our action-RPG game.

I went with skill-based action system for the AI to use, since that was the one I was most familiar with.

## Reflection

Ticorporate project emphasized system-level thinking, scalability, and trade-offs
under real project constraints.
